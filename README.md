A Raspberry Pi GPIO manipulation library for Mono/.NET implementing the wiringPi library (https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi/tree/master/wiringPi) and the libbcm2835 library (http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835/index.html).  The purpose of this library is to provide the ability to read/write the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, as well as interface with the onboard serial (RS232 UARTs) pins, which is an alternate function of 2 of the GPIOs along with some additional interfacing options.  This library is under development and not ready for production use.
